## Thank You!
I would like to thank the **co-founder of Vara** who assigned this project to me. I learned so much throughout the process of creating this project-- I solidified my skills in Tailwind, learned how to use the Google Sheets API, and learned to make something more visually appealing with colors and design. I hope to continue to get better at being a full-stack developer and continue my career growth journey ‡ªíÍí∞‡æÄ‡Ω≤¬¥ Àò ` Íí±‡æÄ‡Ω≤·Éê!</p>
