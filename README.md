## Thank You!
<p align="center">I would like to thank the co-founder of Vara who assigned this project to me. I learned so much throughout the process of creating this project-- I solidified my skills in Tailwind, learned how to use the Google Sheets API, and learned to make something more visually appealing with colors and design. I hope to continue to get better at being a full-stack developer and continue my career growth journey ໒꒰ྀི´ ˘ ` ꒱ྀིა!</p>
